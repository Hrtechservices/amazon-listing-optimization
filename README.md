How can you be sure your product title is appropriate?

Ensure that the character limit is between 100 and 150.
Include suitable keywords in the title, but separate them using dashes (-) or pipe symbols (|).

Well, creativity and optimization are ultimately what matters. It can enhance both ranking and conversion by combining the two.
The description directly impacts the customers. Tell them why you are charging so much for the product. To persuade them to choose you over your competition, try to show them how your product can improve their daily life.

Product Features

One of the critical components of a product listing is its description, and rather than employing lengthy passages, Amazon bullet points are typically used to summarize the product features. This is because it clarifies information and makes it much easier to understand than a paragraph of text. Five bullet points are the sweet spot.

Each key element that sets you apart from your rivals must be mentioned in the bullet points. Make sure it's captivating and persuasive enough to persuade a customer to buy.
For an enhanced list of a product's features, adhere to the suggestions below:

List your product's two most crucial characteristics first, then move on to the less important points.
Use no more than 5 bullet points. If it's essential, go up to 6.
Add CTAs.
Don't forget to mention features that set your product apart from your rivals.
The listing instance given above is a perfect example of an optimized description. It contains all the unique selling propositions of the vacuum cleaner, measurements, and voltage.
